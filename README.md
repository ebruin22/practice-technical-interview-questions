# Practice Python Technical Interview Questions

## Project Purpose
I will complete one algorithm challenge per day from codewars. My python code will also include at least 2 tests.

## Challenges
### January 9, 2018
Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. 
The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. 
The string can contain any char.

### January 10, 2018
Enter an (unsigned) integer convert to binary and return the number of 1's in the binary representation.

### January 14, 2018
Take an integer n (n >= 0) and a digit d (0 <= d <= 9) as an integer. Square all numbers k (0 <= k <= n) between 0 and n. Count the numbers of digits d used in the writing of all the k**2. Call nb_dig (or nbDig or ...) the function taking n and d as parameters and returning this count.
